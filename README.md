# Speech and Language Processing (3rd ed.) Solutions

This repository contains comprehensive solutions and codes for ["Speech and Language Processing"](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) (3rd Edition draft) by Daniel Jurafsky and James H.Martin. 

I am approaching the book in two parts:
1. Part 1 (Chapters from 1 to 11), which covers Natural Language Processing, and
2. Part 2 (Chapter 12 onwards), which mostly deals with Speech Processing. 

Although most of the solutions for part 1 have been solved and shared in this repository, if you find some that are left, try to solve them yourselves and, if possible, contribute your solutions to this repository. 

**Directions:** Solutions and implementation of important models for each chapter are enclosed in their respective folders. The PDF "Speech and Language Processing Compiled Solutions" contains compiled solutions of all the subjective questions solved so far.

**Language and Framework**: Python, PyTorch.

**Future goals:** Implement all the important deep learning models mentioned in part 1. Once done, start with part 2 immediately. 

**Contribute:** I am looking for individuals interested in contributing to this repository. If you are on board, please email me at <utkarsh.j.99@gmail.com> with the subject "Contributing to SLP Solutions". Don't worry if you are not an expert in this field; we will learn together :)

**Questions:** If you have any questions, or want to point out any mistake, direct them at <utkarsh.j.99@gmail.com> with the subject "Question/Mistake in SLP Solutions".
